These categories, and the 12 measures included in the index, are displayed in the chart below; scroll over the measures to learn more.

The BPC rankings include 403 cities defined using the US Office of Managment and Budget delineations for metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and metropolitan divisions (MDs). To account for the influence of population size, the 403 cities are divided into large and small, and rankings are calculated separately for large and small cities. Large and small cities are further divided into five tiers based on their relative performance, with top-ranked cities in Tier 1 and bottom-ranked cities in Tier 5.
